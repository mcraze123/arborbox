It was an IoT indoor garden box self-controlled by sensors and a REST interface.
There was also a web frontend that displayed graphs of sensor reading history.
The temperature was controlled via submersible and ambient temp sensors and fans.
The watering was controlled via submersible pumps and soil moisture sensors.
The lighting cycle was controlled via CFL bulbs and relays.
The fertilizer was added to the water resevoir every other week.
